# React JS Frontend

The Search engine is developed with **[React JS](https://reactjs.org/)** and **[Material-UI Design](https://material-ui.com/)**. 

## Start the Application

Before you can start the app, you have to install all dependencies shown in the *package.json* file. For this, just type in: 

`yarn`

To start the project , you can run this command in the *language-level-search-engine/frontend* directory:

### `yarn start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**IMPORTANT**
Node.JS must be installed on your machine to run the *yarn* command

## Using the Search engine

If you started the application you will see the following website:

Now you have to define the **language of the found results** and your **language level** for this chosen result language. After this, just type in a search value, such as **dog**. 

Now, just klick the Enter key or click on the **SEARCH** button and get to the results page (shown below). For now, there are no results so the page is white. In the navigation bar you can see your chosen values. In the future you will have the ability to filter the results for "All", "News" or "Blogs" (examples).
